            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a results-driven software engineer with experience in developing Python Django-based web portals and implementing innovative solutions. Throughout my career, I have worked on diverse projects, ranging from AI-based comparative online shopping engines to business apps for import/export tasks.
    In my roles at TKXEL, FiveRivers Technologies, and BrainPlow, I have gained expertise in front-end and back-end development, database modeling, and deploying scalable solutions on AWS infrastructure. I have leveraged my skills in Python, Django, and various AWS services to deliver high-quality software solutions.
    Additionally, I have experience in web scraping, utilizing Python libraries and frameworks such as Scrapy, Requests, and Selenium. I have also integrated third-party APIs and services to enhance functionality and user experience.
    Throughout my journey, I have collaborated with cross-functional teams, led requirement gathering phases, and directed front-end teams to ensure seamless user experiences. I have also worked on content moderation and user safety, leveraging technologies such as AWS Image and Video Rekognition.
    With a passion for staying updated with the latest industry trends, I continuously seek opportunities to enhance my skills. If you are looking for a dedicated software engineer with a strong technical background and a track record of delivering impactful solutions, I would be delighted to connect with you.

            <!-- Project: CatchU -->
            <div class="project">
                <h3>CatchU</h3>
                <p>CatchU is a medical project, where different corporate and communities can register themselves. Clients use a web portal and Iphone/Android app to conduct medical tests to calculate a patient's fall risk.
                    The Problem:
                    According to the CDC, nearly 30% of Americans over the age of 65 experience a fall annually. In fact, over 2 million older Americans require an emergency room visit every year because of fall-related injuries.
                    
                    Falls are the leading cause of injury and injury-related death in older adults and are incredibly costly, with over $50 billion spent annually on non-fatal and fatal falls combined.
                    
                    The CDC recommends fall-risk screening annually to help prevent falls. However, screening is underutilized and not routinely integrated into clinical practice.
                    
                    Solution:
                    Mobility requires efficient interaction of musculoskeletal and sensory systems (especially visual, somatosensory, and vestibular) to control everyday movements, and these systems are known to be compromised in aging and linked to cognitive status.
                    
                    Our established system and methods for quantifying multisensory interactions demonstrate clear clinical-translational value with regard to predicting motor outcomes like falls.
                    ​
                    We provide a standardized and mobile multisensory screening test that is quick, easy, affordable, and accessible. Much like the newly implemented cognitive screening test for seniors, seniors will receive a CatchU® mobility app, a fall risk assessment tool for the elderly annually at a minimum, in an effort to assess sensory integration and fall risk in seniors. Those at higher risk of falls and other mobility impairments will receive tailored recommendations from their physicians. The CatchU® fall risk assessment tool for the elderly is eligible for telehealth reimbursement in at-risk patients. Our most important goal is to prevent falls in order to reduce pain and injuries and maintain independence in our aging population</p>
